Sightseeing can be extremely expensive, but you are bloody frugal! It can be surpisingly cheap as well, still you will see more than most of the people do if you follow this guide.

The idea is to see more than usual tourists, but pay less if any for those activities.

I think one great activity on the French Riviera is to go up to the mountains and have a bird's-eye view at the coast. 
Hikes as such: 
Greolieres
Gourdon
Grasse
Sainte-Agnes

Mini lavender field near Gourdon.

If you come early summer, before July. You might have some chance to see some lavender fields. For such a program you need a car. To see huge fields you have to go towards Manosque. But what if you just want to see some lavenders, not a sea of it? Would you be happy to take such a picture?

There is a nice free garden to visit coming down from Gourdon towards Le Loup. The garden belongs to a parfumerie in Gourdon so they grow a wide variety of flowers in their gardens including lavenders.

It’s not just that you can see some smaller fields not far from Nice, but you can also enjoy a wonderful view on the valley of the Loup. In fact visiting this garden nicely fits into a great [day-trip](alt=Check out our day trips!)

How to get there: put link, itinerary.

Free museum days (journee de patrimoine)
Each year there are a few days when you can get into some museums for free. If you are a European frugal, I’m sure you are familiar with the concept of the European Heritage Days when you can visit museums and other different sites for free ot you can participate to events for a nominal fee.

Usually it’s in the middle of September, but you might find some events around. Anyway it’s worth to check out their home page(https://journeesdupatrimoine.culturecommunication.gouv.fr/). It’s also worth to check directly on your target city’s home page or at the Tourist Information Center.

Cote d’Azur Card to batch activities
Let’s say you have some budget for activities. Not much but you want the most of it. In this case it’s a great idea to invest into the Cote d’Azur card. But what is this card anyway?

You have to pay 45 Euros and you can get a 3 day pass which you can use during 6 days. So you might use it on the weekend (Saturday, Sunday) and then until next Thursday.

It’s functioning basically as a museum card. You choose as many activities as you can. Usually museum cards are worth their price if you plan to visit many. The same logic applies here.

On their website they advertise with the following schedule:

Boat trip from Cannes to Ile Saint-Honorat, a wine tasting event in Nice, the Oceanographic Museum in Monaco and a bus trip to Sant-Tropez and you are already 40% off. This is a nice program by the way. But I’m sure if you are extreme, you can make much more out of it.

You can browse the activities here(LINK).

Visit factories

France is the biggest exporter of luxury goods. Those products are produced throughout the country. Of course in one of its most exclusive region too. And there are some that you can visit, usually for free. It gives you a nice insight into a given industry and you might even taste or try some products. You can purchase them too, but you are frugal, right?

Here are some that you can visit:
Confiserie Florian
Parfumerie Galibard Grasse
Parfumerie Molinard Eze
Parfumerie Molinard Grasse

Free things to see in Grasse
In Grasse everything is about parfums. And about the families who founded those factories. So as mentioned before you can visit those factories and the related tourist centers. But it’s more than that. The Fragonard family exposes some nice collections of clothes and furniture in a small museum right next to their factory. (LINK here)
