International kite festival in Frejus

For almost 20 years each October there is an international kite festival in Frejus and the entrance is completely free!

It’s in a huge area called Base Nature and it’s apparently an old airport.

What do you have at a kite festival? That’s right, a lot of kites. Small kites, big kites, huge kites, traditional kites, animal-shaped kites, human-shaped kites, etc.

There are people who just let their kites hover in the sky but there are actually shows and a race too. People move their kites for music.

And it is really international. In 2017 there were kites coming even from Colombia and Japan!

Even if you are not a huge fan of kites I think it’s something worth to see once in a life!

More information [is here](). You can take my word that it’s well signaled as soon as you leave the highway and the there is a huge parking with security. It’s also free.
