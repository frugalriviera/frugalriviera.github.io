Do you think you can feel the Monaco Grand Prix feeling for free? Yes, you can and it’s almost free! Why just almost? You have to get there and I assume you wouldn’t just stay in or walk to Monte Carlo.

I would definitely recommend you to get there by train, it’s worth some extra Euros. But if you go from Nice city center (Nice Ville station) it’s rather difficult to get on the train. When we came for my job interview it was the weekend of the Grand Prix. We were walking in the city center and suddenly we saw a huge queue. What was going on? It was simply the GP. People were waiting a lot (I guess hours) to get on a train.

If you just take the train from a few stations farther - even by traveling in the opposite direction, you’d have no problem to get on the train. At least this is our experience. The train will still be crowded, but you’ll be - maybe sitting! - in that crowd, not the one wasting its time outside.

To come back, it’s another story. It depends where you finish, it might be worth to take the bus. But it’s definitely good to stay in the principality for a few hours.

So what can you do without a ticket in Monaco? First of all, why not getting a ticket? They are expensive, yes. But being frugal doesn’t necessarily mean to be poor and/or cheap.

If you walk around the track and the closed zones before the practices/qualification/race, you can find people selling places on their terraces. Usually these are more expensive than the normal places, but there are huge drops in price close to the events. If it’s your dream, don’t be shy, check it out.

If you decide not to buy yourself in, you can just wander around. There are always some centers organized by the biggest sponsors. You can get some swag. A few years ago we got some Ferrari caps and ashtrays by playing with VR, some simulators.

It’s usually worth to go up to the castle. On your way up, usually there are a few, okay few, places from where you can have some far glances on the track. You can actually see some cars. Taller people are definitely in advantage. Having a tall seat or a ladder…

A few minutes after the race and the ceremony finished you can get on the track! For a few hours everyone can walk on it while the traffic is still not released on the streets. You can walk around where your favourites went flat out a few minutes before.

You can even stand on the podium, look at this picture!

And if you are a real fan of formula one you can get some tyre parts from the track. There are a lot, but be quick, because many collect those parts. 

If there were some unlucky drivers you can be lucky and get some carbon parts of a Formula 1 car. I don’t say you’ll actually build a car from these parts, but maybe they will be some nice souvenirs for you.

Don’t forget that souvenirs in Monaco are cheaper than in Nice. If you go for the Grand Prix, you can buy your magnets there.
