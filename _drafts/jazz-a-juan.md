Every July around the Bastille day there is the famous jazz festival in the heart of Juan Les Pins. In the [Pinede]() they always build a concert arena (A WHAAAT).

You can buy tickets for the festival in advance, and for the main singer (list a few from the last years) you really should buy in advance, and still you might not be lucky.
But you have two other options as well. Every year there is a free day. Some years it’s the 14th of July and you can get tickets from the Office de Tourisme. Usually you have to queue in the morning because they only give out a limited amount of tickets each year. And only 2 per person. In the past you didn’t have to prove that you’re local.

The other option is that you just a grab a nice bottle of rose and you go the park or the beach around. You can hear the concerts pretty well and you don’t have to spend anything.
