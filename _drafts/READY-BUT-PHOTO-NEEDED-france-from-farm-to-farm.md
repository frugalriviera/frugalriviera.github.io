For 20 years, each spring there is a weekend when people in France can visit hundreds of farms, taste their products for free and buy them - for a fee. It's a great initiative allowing (sub)urban people to visit farms that otherwise probably you don't even know about. Besides spending some good time in nature and hopefully tasting something not coming from mass production, you can also learn about nature and agriculture.

Last year we wanted to visit a couple of farms around Grasse while my father was visiting us, but my daughter got sick so we only went to the closest one, to a new [goat farm in Valbonne](https://www.facebook.com/LaChevrerieDeValbonne/). We saw the goats led by the shepherd and his dog and in the barn, we could also meet a lot of baby goats and even some sheep resting under infrared lights. We could caress and feed them which was a great experience for the children!

We took the opportunity and bought some fresh and some aged cheese - all were very tasty!

This year, we went a bit further, we'd like to do the tour we couldn't do last year. We planned to go around Grasse and visit a couple of places. We ended visiting two places.

We visited the [Ch√®vrerie du Bois d'Amon](http://www.chevrerieduboisdamon.fr/) which happened to be an experience even for me! We arrived at a good moment to see how milk is pumped from the goats while they were being fed. The kids could help put on the pumps on the animals. I was happy to see that my shy daughter went there and helped the farmer.

Later, we could taste the freshest milk I ever tasted. Everyone got a bit of milk just pumped by hand a couple of seconds before. That was pure goat milk, baby! How creamy and warm it was!

Once my daughter played enough with the small trucks and the different gardener tools and we ate some goat ice-cream we headed to the other place in our itinerary, [Entre terre et miel](https://www.entreterreetmiel.com/).

This one was not worth it and was not very interesting. Later we learnt that we arrived in the wrong moment. At lunchtime, everyone was busy either with eating or with making or serving the lunch. The activities were already done in the morning. Maybe next time.

I hope I learnt once and for all that should rather trust wife and my instincts instead of the GPS. Leaving from [Entre terre et miel](https://www.entreterreetmiel.com/) I took a gravel road that was supposed to lead to a big road going to Grasse but instead after some really steep parts it ended up in a villa on the hillside on the right and centre, the big mountain on the left. I could barely turn back on the narrow path, it took like 5-10 minutes even though I have a car that is really easy to manoeuvre with and I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have been able to accomplish this a couple of years ago.

It reminded me some foreign truck driver in Hungary how followed the GPS, ended up in the forest and stuck in for days due to the heavy rain and sticky mud. When he was freed with the help of the police, he took his GPS threw it on the ground and destroyed it with his feet. My GPS is built-in...

Anyway, if you have access to a car - it's inevitable - and understand a little bit of French (or use Google Translate with confidence), check out the site of [La France de ferme en ferme](https://www.defermeenferme.com/departement-06-alpes-maritimes) and stay tuned for the next edition!`
