After having read some tips on [how to rent a car on the Riviera]() in this new article, it's time to discuss how and where we can park in the region!

If you decide to rent a car you will have to park it somewhere. I assume that if you rent a car, you thought ahead. Meaning that you planned to stay at a hotel or an apartment where this is not a problem. But still, you don’t rent a car to park it next to your temporary home while you’re taking buses, trains and walk long distances, do you? You want to visit sites, cities, villages where you will also have to park it.

Usually you can find the most up-to-date information about free parkings right on the website of the given city/village. If you don't speak French, usually it doesn't help a lot. On the other hand, many local sites written for tourists are translated in English too.

What I’ve seen in the villages and smaller cities of the Riviera is that they make you pay for the parking in the center. However if you are willing to walk about 10 minutes, then you’ll probably find a big parking with enough slots for free.

Keep in mind that it matters when you want to park. Not just hours and days, but also the months. In Antibes for example there is a big parking on the beach, right next to the old town which is free except for 2 or 3 months. It’s not a unique case.

If you are visiting Nice by car then the ticket [PARCAZUR](https://www.lignesdazur.com/en/park-and-rides-parcazur/102) can be for you! For 3 Euros it gives you the possibility of leaving your car at any of the 5 available covered and guarded parking, plus you have 2 tram tickets so you can get into and back from the city center. This is a much better option than paying a lot of money for a few hours of parking and fighting through the jam in the center.

## Conclusion

Parking in bigger cities can be difficult, but if you are ready to walk a bit, you'll usually find big areas offering free parkings, many times even free shuttles to the center. Also, if you are nice, check out the [PARCAZUR](https://www.lignesdazur.com/en/park-and-rides-parcazur/102) ticket to combine driving with taking the tram.

Stay tuned!



## Bus

If you have a lot of time, it’s a much cheaper option than anything else. It’s much slower too. 

How much? If you want to take a train from Cannes to Monaco it would normally take you about an hour and approximately 10 Euros. 

If you take the bus, you have to change in Nice and walk a good quarter of an hour, overall it would take you about up to 2 or 3 hours. But it would cost you only 1.5 Euros.

In the beginning I used to take the bus a lot between Antibes and Nice. If the traffic is in your favor it can be even less than 1 hour, but if your bus got stuck in the jam, even 2 hours is imaginable.

If you decide to take the bus to save some pennies you can either get the bus with a “correspodance” ticket to some local line, so you can take another bus on ENVIBUS for example, or you can buy a 10 ticket card for only 10 Euros.

## Rail

As I described the train is much more expensive than the bus, but it is - most of the time - also more comfortable and faster.

Even though it is expensive, you have some options to go frugal with the train.

### Zou Pass

It’s a day pass during the summer season. In the whole department you can take any train during the day of validity for 15 Euros.

It can be less expensive than buying all the tickets you’d need during a day and it is definitely much more comfortable. You’ll have only one ticket that you have to validate only once when you take your first train.

### World day of public transport 

In the middle of September there are 2 of 3 days when you can buy a special ticket for 5 Euros which are valid for all the local trains (TER) in the region (PACA) during the whole day. It means you can get from Menton to Marseille and back for only 5 Euros.

That’s a great deal. It’s really about making public transportation more popular. Usually there is a weekend when you can pick any of the two days and there is also a weekday available. Pick the latter if you can. Trains will be less crowded if you avoid the commuters and those who couldn't take the day off.

We benefit from this program every year. Some days are under the umbrella of the world heritage day, some are labeled with the name public transportation day.

Reserve for “Big lines” in advance
In the previous two sections we covered mostly local trains (TER), but there are other ones called “big lines” (Grandes Lignes). These can be intercity, high speed and/or even international trains. Usually they are a bit more expensive for short distances, but for long ones can compete even with airplanes.

Wait? Trains against airplanes? Yes! Imagine, that your TGV takes you from Nice to Paris in 5.5 hours. It departs from the city center and drops you off at [the city center](https://goo.gl/maps/UHF39vNMUSB2). If you have to go to the airport and and then at your destination you have to take a train to reach the city. And I haven’t even mentioned that these days you have to be present at the airport quite in advance.

Price-wise you really have to pay attention. Train ticket prices can really go up as your travel date is approaching and might be more expensive than airplanes. However if you try to purchase your ticket as soon as it is available (3 months in advance with SNCF - DOUBLECHECK) you can have really low fees. I did the Nice-Paris/Paris-Nice trip several times for 25 Euros per person per direction.

Another option is to take a night train. You don’t really lose time with your travel and you don’t even have to pay for a hotel room. When I was a student and I had an internship in Franche-Comté, France, I took a night train from [Montbéliard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montb%C3%A9liard) to Nice. I took a train in the evening and by the next early morning I was swimming in the Mediterranean sea. 

Either you take a TGV, you travel during night hours or you just take an intercity train, don’t forget that on trains you don’t have to pay extra for a suitcase or two. It’s not the case on airplanes… And you can also eat/drink whatever you bring with yourself. Well, maybe you shouldn’t eat your recently bought strong cheese...
Airlines
Of course you can fly during your vacations in France. Needles to say check the low cost companies.
But it’s also worth checking traditional companies, in this case Air France. Lately airlines started to really segment their tickets, and even on traditional airlines you can get tickets without a single sandwich, without any checked-in baggage.

When you compare airlines and prices, don’t forget to take into consideration how much a suitcase costs you.

And again, check for the season. Travel in off season and you will pay less.
