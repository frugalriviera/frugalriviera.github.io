Last October, we went to La Colle sur Loup to enjoy a beer festival on the French Riviera.

La Colle sur Loup has a sister city in Germany since 1976, Zuzenhaused (Baden-Württemberg). The idea of having an own Oktoberfest is so obvious.

There are other small beer festivals around, but this had a great advantage for us. It's very easy to reach with public transportation - depending on where you live of course. But you can get there from the center of Antibes (or Villeneuve-Loubet too) without changing buslines.

The bus doesn't go frequently and it takes a bit more than half an hour from Antibes, but at least you can go and enjoy the drinks.

[Drinking out on the Riviera](http://frugalriviera.com/blog/2019/03/06/drinking-out-on-the-riviera) is expensive. In fact it was not really cheaper here either. A nice pint of beer cost 5 Euros, plus you had to buy a plastic cup. I liked the idea of the plastic mug that one would reuse many times, but this was the first time that it was actually not for a deposit. If you drink only one beer, that one Euro raises the price by 20 percent. But if you go to a beer festival, you don't go for one beer, right?

The staff members were seemingly amateurs, but it's not a problem for such small events, it can even be considered charming.

The beer was tasty, a medium bodied bodied German Märzen beer made in Germany according to the mug. Unfortunately the beer came with too much foam, but that must have been because of the lack of experience of the bartenders.

I had a look around and one of the local breweries, [Biere 06](https://www.biereb06.fr/), were also there. Normally I would find the 6 Euros price quite elevated, but given that it was only 1 Euro more than the official festival beer, I gave it a try. It was medium-full bodied, bit fruity, yet bitter beer. Which one to drink? Probably the latter was better.

How this event fits into frugality? 5 or 6 Euros for a beer is not cheap, but given that we can bring our own snacks, water and we visited another village, it's okay once in a while and still cheaper than many of the pubs.
