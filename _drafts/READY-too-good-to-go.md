Throwing out food is bad. Period. It's not only wasting our resources, but it's also dubious morally when so many people don't have enough to eat.

Software developers are not like [Bruce Willis who saved the world so many times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFtTLZ3rmsY), but we can help a little bit. In this post, I'd like to recommend an app that helps decrease the amount of food landing in the waste bins of the restaurants/supermarkets - which is [banned by French law since 2016](https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2018/02/24/586579455/french-food-waste-law-changing-how-grocery-stores-approach-excess-food). 

I used [OptiMiam](https://www.optimiam.com/) in Paris and it was fine, but on the Riviera, especially in Antibes, it's more [TooGoodToGo](https://toogoodtogo.fr/fr) that offers enough choices.

The story is simple. The evening before, or that very day you check the app and you select the place from where you'd like to buy some leftover. Obviously, you don't know in advance what will be in your bag. It depends on the day, on luck. Sometimes it's written that you should bring your own box - after all this is about not wasting our resources! Other times, it's needless.

What you know in advance is where and when you'll have to collect your food, if you need to bring containers and you know the minimum value of the food you'd receive. 

There are some supermarkets, bakeries and even some restaurants participating. We really like this initiative! It's a clear win-win and most of the times, we are happy with what we receive. It's also a good and wallet-friendly way to try out some fancier bakeries.

You can use [TooGoodToGo](https://toogoodtogo.fr/fr) both with a credit card or with [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com). You never have to pay in the store, unless you have to buy some bags.

_Disclaimer. [TooGoodToGo](https://toogoodtogo.fr/fr) doesn't pay for this article. I simply find them great!_
