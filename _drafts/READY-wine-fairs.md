Do you want to taste some French wine? You can buy some bottles in the supermarket. Do you want to taste many different wines without getting wasted or waste a lot of fermented grape juice? Wine fairs and festivals are your places then!

Almost every month you can find some in the region.

Normally they are organised in big spaces, like in stadiums, fair centres, etc. They are like just any other fair. 

If you wander around with your tasting glass and try to make eye contact with the sellers or even try to talk to them some will offer you a bit of wine to taste. Or something else. Usually, you can find chocolate, cheese, sausages, whatever. You can find enough to taste in order not to feel thirsty and hungry. Though it can be a good idea to bring a bottle of water with yourself.

If you find that you are not offered enough wine, don't be shy to ask for some. It can be hard if you are shy like me, but you will not face a lot of rejection. Lately, I asked even for cognac and champagne. They were excellent!

Of course, you can buy these things, but sellers don’t even try to make you feel you have to buy anything. Personally, this way I feel like buying something much more.

These fairs are not for free! The entrance fee is between 5 and 8 Euros that includes a tasting glass.

But you are reading [Frugal Riviera](frugalriviera.com)! There must be another way!

And of course, there is! No, I don’t mean that you should hide at the place the night before - it might be an idea though -  or to jump some fences.

If you want to go and you have an extra 10 minutes, start to check the websites of the different participating winemakers. You can always find downloadable invitations, or you just have to send a mail and they will send the free invitation in reply. You print them in as many examples as you need and you go for free. In this case, you have to buy your tasting glass for usually 2 Euros.

We always follow this latter way and even though I think I could use my previous tasting glasses, I don’t. I always feel that it’s well worth that 2 Euros.
