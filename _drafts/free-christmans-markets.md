Maybe the French Riviera is not the most famous from its wintery settings, but still a Christmas market is a Christmas market. Some nice events where you can stroll alone, with a partner or even with children. 

The best ones are in Nice and Monaco. I think buying is not so great there, but you can actually eat some good and relatively well priced food and you can just look around.

The Monaco one has a different theme every year, any nation can be a theme, actually it can get quite interesting. Here is a picture fromâ€¦.
