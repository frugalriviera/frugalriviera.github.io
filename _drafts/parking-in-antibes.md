Parking in Antibes

Parking in Antibes might be difficult and expensive, but if you know a couple of things, it can become almost free and relatively easy! Good news is that you're at the right place.

As usually in France, if you are okay with walking to the city center, you can find some free parkings. It's not different in Antibes, either.

## Free parkings

A couple of free parkings that are in a walking distance from the center:

- [Parking next to the Port Vauban](https://goo.gl/maps/oVHE68G21k5YTr4S6), close to the Fort Carré (Fortress of Antibes)
- [Parking next to Fort Carré](https://goo.gl/maps/dU1yL9NvXVDsyj8G6)
- [Parking Bunoz, not far from Anthea](https://goo.gl/maps/GipndaeQrsD2)

What is an extra regarding the first two parking that there is a free shuttle service connecting them to the city center. You can get the latest schedules [here](http://www.envibus.fr/en/bus-routes/ligne-14.html#horaires).

Please not that there are more free parkings in Antibes, but I don't they are close enough to the center.

# A parking sometimtes free, sometimes not

[Parking Ponteil](https://goo.gl/maps/pzCqBNnP9S6buK476) is right on the beach and only a few steps away from the city center. It's pretty well-located and quite big. The only thing is that if you come in the summer, you'll have to pay for it. Between the beginning of October and the end of May it's free.

Anyway, if you are frugal, don't come in the summer period. Though the beginning of June or September might be a wise decision.

# Toll parking

If you are looking for toll parkings, Frugal Riviera is not your page. Kidding. Sometimes, you have no other options. But there are already good resources to fund just any parking. [Here](http://www.antibes-juanlespins.com/proximite/stationnement/parkings-de-la-ville) you can find all the parkings of Antibes - Juan-les-Pins.

# Other options

There are some "secret places". They are not free parkings, but some streets where you can park for free still they are close enough.

The rest
- city
- undergroung
- parking house
