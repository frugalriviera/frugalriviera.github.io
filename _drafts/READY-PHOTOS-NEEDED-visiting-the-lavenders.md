One of the biggest attractions of Provence during summer is the vast lavender fields. They might seem to a bit distant from the Cote d'Azur, but if you have a car it's a comfortably doable one-day trip.

What we can definitely advise is to leave as early as possible so that you arrive at the fields before the big tourist groups do.

The fields that are closest to a highway are between Manosque and Valensole, so I advise to start with other ones because of three reasons
- there are closer ones to the Riviera
- if you get to Manosque/Valensole as early as we suggest, the shops will still be closed
- we think there are nicer ones

We advise approaching the centre of lavenders from the east. In less cryptic, go through Riez, take the D6 and go towards Valensole. After about two-thirds of the distance, when you have the small road going to Catalany on the left, you will see a huge lavender field on the right. Probably you'll notice it much before you'd notice the road - if at all.

We were there by around half past 8, not super early, but early enough with two children. There was almost nobody else, and thanks to the hilly landscape, it was a particularly nice lavender field.

After, I would advise you to cross Valensole and visit the more famous, more populated fields. There are a bunch of distilleries and shops where you can buy lavender oils and other products and there are a lot of sunflower fields as well. You can make particularly nice pictures at the border of the two types of fields.

It's not really needed to have an exact itinerary here, anyway, you'll stop where you like it. But it's not really worth to go further than Domaine Les Grandes Marges. By the way, when we were there in 2019, they had awesome lavender and calisson creams. I definitely recommend to taste them.

It might change, but we found the best deals at [_Lavandes Angelvin_]([https://www.lavande-valensole.fr/).

Why do you go to the lavender fields? Most probably to shoot dozens of pictures, maybe to buy some essential oils and other souvenirs. With this, you can finish in fact before noon.

Getting back to the Riviera will not take more than two hours, so there is still plenty of time.

This is a particularly rich area in things to do and see.

You can do some water paddling at Quinson or in Valley of Verdon. You can take some rest on the beach and have some rest.

Or maybe you can climb the hills and visit [Moustiers-Sainte-Marie](https://www.moustiers.fr/en). 

The choice is yours and it's difficult to make a wrong one.
