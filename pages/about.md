We are making this website that gives hints and best practices for frugal people who want to explore the Cote d'Azur. Our driving force is that we find that many travellers think that the French Riviera is way too expensive and one cannot enjoy herself without throwing a load of money away. We can prove them wrong.

We live on the Cote d'Azur since 2013 and being frugal travellers we keep our eyes open even at home looking for the best value for our money. It's true that the French Riviera is not the cheapest vacation destination in the world, not even in France, but if you plan it wise, even if you are not the rich kid from the block, you can make it and you will enjoy it a lot.

We think it's important to emphasize that being frugal is not the same as being cheap. Cheapness uses price as a bottom line; frugality uses value as a bottom line. Hence we might suggest you a Michelin starred lunch if we think it provides a really good quality/price ratio, but we are also not afraid of saying that you should buy your own drinks at the supermarket and go to the beach instead of a bar, or that you should rent a small utility van instead of a compact car.

Please note that generally we don't receive any renumeration for suggesting you to use certain products of services. In case we do, we put a disclamer that it is a sponsored post. Still, we will not suggest you anything that we think it's not worth paying for.

Enjoy the articles and should you have any questions or suggestions for topics to cover, don't hesitate to comment or [drop us a mail](mailto:frugal.riviera@gmail.com).
