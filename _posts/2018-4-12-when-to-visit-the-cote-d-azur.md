So you want to come to the French Riviera, but you are a frugal person or just simply you don’t have a lot of money? No problem! The first step is to determine when to come here!
<!--more-->

Don’t come in July or August. The hotels are full, the flight tickets are expensive and anyway everything is so crowded. We live here and even for us that’s the period we like the least. Avoid July and August!

In June and September you have quite good chances to have a nice weather here, and if you are okay with a little bit cold sea, you can even swim! There are some chances of rain, but it usually does not last for days. The shops and restaurants are still open.

In October and November it rains a lot on the Côte d’Azur. It’s not by chance that it’s one of the wettest region in France even though the number of sunny days is really high. It doesn’t rain that frequently but when it rains, it heavily does.

Winter is usually nice here. There is not a lot of rain in January and February and the average temperature is still about 10 degrees Celsius. In fact the Côte d’Azur became famous and popular starting from the late 18th century when English people begun to spend their winter holidays on the French Riviera. Doctors even sent here people to enjoy a climato-therapy! Come in February and feel like a lord!
