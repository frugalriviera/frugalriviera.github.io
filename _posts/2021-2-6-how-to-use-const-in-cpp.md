I've got some great news to share with you. Based on my series on [when to use `const` in C++](https://www.sandordargo.com/blog/2020/11/04/when-use-const-1-functions-local-variables), I wrote a book on the same topic and I released it on [LeanPub](https://leanpub.com/cppconst/)!

In the book, I discuss the idea of constness which is so important that in certain languages entities are `const`, in other words, immutable by default. If you want to become a seasoned C++ developer, you must understand how you can use `const` correctly. In this book, you'll learn when and how to use it in the different contexts it might appear:

- `const` functions
- `const` local variables
- `const` member variables
- `const` return types
- `const` parameters

Compared to the series of articles, the book contains extra code examples, more explanations and also the differences between *`const` west* and *east `const`* - without starting a holy war on different coding styles.
